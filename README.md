# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Breast cancer, a prevalent malignancy originating from breast tissue cells, poses a significant health risk worldwide. While predominantly associated with women, breast cancer can affect individuals of any gender due to the presence of breast tissue in all humans. Consequently, early detection and accurate prediction are paramount for effective treatment and improved prognosis. In this report, a novel ensemble approach for breast cancer prediction is presented, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 98%. The methodology involves the integration of various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression, within a stacking classifier framework. By combining the strengths of these diverse models, the ensemble approach harnesses collective predictive power to enhance accuracy and robustness.
